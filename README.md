# Funnel-analysis-events

## Welcome to my project on Funnel Analysis!

I focused on **"Funnel Analysis: User Journey from Page View to Purchase"**   
For this project. I've chosen these steps for a funnel because they represent the critical stages of a customer's journey from browsing to completing a purchase. Users who complete the purchase contribute directly to revenue.

**[View the project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hRB_jGQurq4fs8ds1AC2VoYcAZoL35v8MWfKkmvsLr4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)**  

My funnel analysis is split into top countries (US, Canada, India) from the internal data, using  `turing_data_analytics.raw_events`.  

The initial questions were:
- Which countries have hosted the most events overall?
- How does the number of events change for the top countries from the first stage of the funnel to the last? 
- What is the conversion rate from the initial stage to the final stage of the funnel?


On my Google Spreadsheets, you will find my SQL Query, my Funnel Overview, and an analysis sheet:


   **Funnel Overview** includes:
   - SQL Query to clean and aggregate data
   - Table with the results of the query
   - Query to extract and aggregate the needed data by events and countries
   - Table: Events and Conversion Rate %
   - Total Events (Thousands) and Conversion Rate (%) from Top Countries
   - Stage Conversion Rate (%) per Country (Graphs)
   - Conclusion and Actions
